# Amrita Student Connect Application Dev for What's the Hack.
Project Headed by Revanth Damisetty along with Karthikeyan Saravanan and Siva Dhanush Kosuri
This project is a Application Developement Project constituted under the theme of Web and App Development
This project solves the student communication gap and helps them to attend the club events and other technical and non technical fests in Amrita with great ease.
We have designed this project keeping the difficulties of the problems faced by the students pursuing their course in Amrita
We definitely hope that this idea on developing ASConnect Application would fulfill the needs of the student body to conduct events efficiently and improve students particiption rate.
